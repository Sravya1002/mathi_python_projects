
# Defined block of code which is used to perform a specific task.
# Functions are defined in python with keyword 'def'
# Functions can have arguments.
# Functions can return value if needed
# a = 10
# b = 20
# print(a+b)
#
# a = 50
# b = 60
# print(a+b)
#
# a = 100
# b = 200
# print(a+b)

         #  used as null functions
